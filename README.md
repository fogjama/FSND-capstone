#### Installing Dependencies

A virtual environment is recommended for running the application. 

Once you have your virtual environment set up and running, install dependencies from the `requirements.txt` file:

```pip install -r requirements.txt

```

This will install all of the required packages.

#### Database Setup

To create the database structure in your local postgres database, run the following commands:

```
python manage.py db init
python manage.py db migrate
python manage.py db upgrade
```
